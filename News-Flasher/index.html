                    In recent times, with the development of new technology, many new feats have been reached. However,
                    with
                    great power with some individuals, others paid a dire price...
                </p>

                <h3>The rundown</h3>
                <p>
                    On June 15th 3018, NASA decided to finally begin their Mars colonisation project. With the 20
                    astronauts sent up for the 7-month journey, only 11 could come back to their families.
                </p>

                <h3>What is the SKELD</h3>
                <p>
                    The SKELD is a marvel of modern engineering, a spaceship that pushes the boundaries of imagination
                    and
                    technology. As you step aboard this futuristic vessel, you are greeted by sleek metallic surfaces
                    that
                    reflect the soft glow of the ambient lighting, creating an atmosphere of elegance and
                    sophistication. It
                    is a true pioneer in space travel, and it has the following abilities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hologram, able to receive a signal from over 100 AU away</li>
                    <li>An emergency vessel in the event of an emergency</li>
                    <li>The first ever hybrid space vehicle! It utilises the power of nuclear energy and sustainability
                        of solar energy
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The details</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the autopsy provided by NASA and the world's finest secret services (MI5, MI6, GCHQ, FBI,
                    RAW,
                    etc.), we can't say much to the public what happened, but we can say the following things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The murders occurred in a short amount of time, with the nine murders occurring in just under 2
                        hours
                    </li>
                    <li>The victims seemed to have been killed with a sharp object through the head, much sharper than
                        the
                        knives supplied
                    </li>
                    <li>All surviving crew are in court as of now, including myself. We are all to present out
                        testimonies,
                        and I only want mine for the world to see my innocence
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
                <p>Overall, this was originally going to be a pioneering trip into the unknown, but I have been left
                    traumatised, a mental scar left in my mind. Thank you for taking the time to read this article and
                    testimony by me</p>
